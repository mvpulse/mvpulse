# MVPulse - Project One-Pager

## Decentralized Polling & Rewards Platform on Movement Network

---

## The Problem

Traditional polling platforms are:
- **Centralized** - Data can be manipulated, results lack transparency
- **Unrewarding** - Users give opinions but receive nothing in return
- **Siloed** - No integration with Web3 ecosystems or token economies

## Our Solution

**MVPulse** is a decentralized polling platform where users earn real token rewards for participating in polls. Built on Movement Network, it combines transparent on-chain voting with a comprehensive gamification system.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Token-Rewarded Polls** | Earn MOVE, PULSE, or USDC for every vote |
| **Questionnaires** | Bundled surveys with shared reward pools |
| **PULSE Staking** | Stake tokens to unlock higher tiers and more daily votes |
| **Referral System** | Earn rewards by inviting friends |
| **Project Organization** | Team collaboration with role-based access |
| **Gasless Transactions** | Shinami-powered gas sponsorship for seamless UX |

## How It Works

```
Creator funds poll with tokens
        ↓
Users vote on-chain
        ↓
Poll closes, rewards distributed
        ↓
Voters claim their earnings
```
